        <p> In highschool, I was the Vice President of the Science 
            Olympiad team, and won many medals in various events, including Write It Do It,
            Codebusters, and Experimental Design. I was also President of the Artificial
            Intelligence club, where I taught AI and ML to our members. I was part of
            Wind Ensemble and Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as Pep Band. Outside school, I 
            volunteered as a curriculum creator for two non-profit programs aimed at
            providing accessible STEM education to young students. I taught multiple topics
            including physics, math, Java, bio, Python, and French. I was also a marketing
            coordinator for the Bay Area Youth Career Opportunities (BAYCO) program, where
            I managed our social media and oragnized events such as workshops, career fairs, 
            and educational online webinars for students in our district.</p>
